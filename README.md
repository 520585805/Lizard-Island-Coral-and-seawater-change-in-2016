## Hypothesis:
Seawater temperature, pH, and salinity influence coral bleaching, coverage and species change in the Lizard Island Group of the Great Barrier Reef, and a synergistic effect existed during the mass-bleaching event in 2016.
## Analysis Plan:
1. Make a map showing the location of the study area on the Great Barrier Reef
2. Make a heat map demonstrating the change in water temperature on Lizard Island over the seasons from January 2011 to December 2016
3. Make a heat map demonstrating seasonal change in seawater pH on Lizard Island over the seasons from January 2011 to December 2016
4. Make a heat map demonstrating seasonal change in seawater senility on Lizard Island over the seasons from January 2011 to December 2016
5. Make a figure demonstrating water temperature anomalies in the waters of the Lizard Island Group in March 2016
6. Make a graph demonstrating seawater pH anomalies in the waters of the Lizard Island Group in March 2016
7. Make a graph demonstrating seawater senility anomalies in the waters of the Lizard Island Group in March 2016
8. Make a figure showing the distribution of target reefs
9. Make a figure demonstrating the core formulae and principles of the Geodetector
10. Make a table demonstrating the Pearson correlation index between the seawater elements at the location to evidence whether the seawater elements are correlated and independent of each other
11. Make a table demonstrating the q-value index calculated by Geodetector for seawater elements and coral bleaching, cover and species at the site to determine whether a factor has an effect on the production of a certain result and the extent of that effect.
12. Make a table demonstrating the relevance of the interaction and synergy between two different factors of the seawater element at the point of location and the outcome.
13. Make a figure demonstrating the synergy of the seawater element at the point where it is located
